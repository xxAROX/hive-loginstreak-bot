# Welcome to the Step-by-step guide
1. Create a repo from this template-repository or if you lazy like me [click here](https://github.com/new?template_name=hive-loginstreak-bot&template_owner=xxAROX). 
2. **Make the new repository private**, so nobody can catch your xbox account credentials.
3. Add your xbox account:
   1. Clone your repo on you PC or create a Codespace for it.
   2. Run `npm install` after that run `npm run "add account"`
   3. Be patient and wait for a message.
   4. Copy the code and go to the [login website](https://www.microsoft.com/link).
   5. Login process
   6. BOOM! Account added!
5. Upload the `.accounts` folder to your **private repository**, you forked in step one.
6. Now the script should execute a workflow, and helps you with the loginstreak!
